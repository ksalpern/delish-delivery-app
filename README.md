# Delish Unleashed: Eliftech's testcase Delivery Web App

Click [here](https://delish-ksalpern.netlify.app/) to see the web app and [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa1cyS55OpU) to see how it looks in my computerðŸ˜ƒ

I was given a tight deadline of just three days to develop this app, but I'm thrilled with the outcome! Nearly a year ago, I applied for an opportunity at Eliftech and completed a similar task. Looking back at what I accomplished last year [here](https://github.com/ksalpern/delivery-app/tree/master), I can see significant progress in my skills. Now, the app I've built is a completely different and improved version. Initially, I struggled with deploying the app, but I've since mastered even the most advanced aspects of the task. While there are still areas where I can further enhance the app, I believe the results so far are impressive. I sincerely hope you'll enjoy it as much as I do. Thank you!

## What will I see in this build

ðŸ‘‰ a fully responsive fullstack delivery site with sass

ðŸ‘‰ React.js and Redux toolkit for handling state

ðŸ‘‰ you can choose a shop and add goods to the cart

ðŸ‘‰ your order, shop Id and the shop location saves to the Local storage, so you won't lose info after reloading the page

ðŸ‘‰ you can only buy goods from one shop

ðŸ‘‰ Google maps, so you can see where the shop is located and see the address after clicking to the marker

ðŸ‘‰ handling the errors and success page after submitting a form with your info
